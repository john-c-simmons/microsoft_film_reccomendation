This project helps Microsoft decide what route to take in order to be successful in diving into the movie industry. Descriptive analysis shows how the movie industry trend is looking and what routes Microsoft can take in order to set themselves up for success.​

## Business Problem

Microsoft has never attempted to go into the movie industry before, so there will be some big decisions they will have to decide on. One thing that is not going to be an obstacle for them will be funding. However, with the research we gathered, maximizing production budgets alone does not have the highest chance of success.


## Data

The data sources included are:
[IMBD]  https://www.imdb.com/ 
[Numbers Database] https://www.the-numbers.com/

We focused on two main metrics for success in the film industry:
Our first measure of success is the net profit, which was determined as total gross minus the production costs of the movies being produced.
Our second measure of success is the return on investment, which was determined as net profit divided by the production costs of the movies.


## Methods

We used a descriptive analysis of data for the movie industry over time, with a focus on the last decade. Our advice provides Microsoft with a guide to help make their decision on venturing into movie production.
Our recommendations focus on the budgetary investment, the genre of films, and the timing of release dates.​


## Results

#### Visual 1

Movie earnings are showing a positive trend within the past five years. Box office ticket sales are rising, indicating that this is a good time for Microsoft to go into the movie industry.

The lower budget range is the blue colored dots on the graph above. Data on low budget films suggest that if Microsoft decides to produce a movie in this budget range then it is possible to make a high proportional profit but these cases are rare and the returns are small. The larger budget films (in orange) have the capacity to earn large profits, but the overall fiscal exposure is greater. The middle 50% of movies are in the moderate budget range (green dots), and they have mixture of high potential gain with lower financial risk.

Within the budget range of $5-45 million films, Drama and Comedy are the two genres that are the most successful in bringing a return of investment greater than two times their original budget.

For the largest budget movies in the $45-400 million range, Action and Adventure are the two genres that are the most successful in bringing a return on investment greater than two times their original budget.

The most successful moderate budget films are released throughout the year, with minimal variation throughout the year. Our recommendation is that Microsoft should try to not release during the summer months in order to successfully bring in a return of investment greater than two times their original budget.

The larger budget successful films seem to be released during summer and early winter peaks. Microsoft should try to release during the summer and winter months in order to successfully bring in a return of investment greater than two times their original budget.


## Conclusions

There are two routes that yield high chances for success:
The first route that Microsoft can take is to produce films with a moderate budget of $5-45 million. If they choose to spend a moderate amount on their production then they should focus creating drama or comedy movie and they should aim to not release their movie during the summer months.
The second route that Microsoft can take is to produce films with a large budget of $45-400 million. If they choose to spend a large amount on their production thwn they should focus on creating action/adventure movies and aim to release during the summer or winter months.

## Next Steps

Further analysis that could help Microsoft:
It would be beneficial to look at what trend the streaming market is instead of box office trends. Microsoft may have an easier transition into creating a streaming service instead of going into the movie theaters
